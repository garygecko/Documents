**Why did we choose PinkSale?**

PinkSale is all about creating a safe environment for investors like you to invest in crypto projects. And let's be real, safety is always a top priority, especially when it comes to investing your hard-earned money. That's why PinkSale has implemented strict KYC procedures to make sure that no dangerous or deceptive behaviour can enter their platform. You can invest with confidence, knowing that PinkSale is a legitimate and secure place to invest.

At the end of the day, what matters most to Gary is that you feel protected and safe when investing in our project. And we know that PinkSale shares that same sentiment. That's why we chose them as our launchpad for our Fair Launch.
